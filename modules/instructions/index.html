            <h2>1. Basic Rules and Objective</h2>
            <p>Baccarat is a comparing card game played between two hands: the Player and the Banker. The objective of the game is simple—bet on which hand will have a total closest to 9. There are three possible outcomes for each round: the Player wins, the Banker wins, or it ends in a Tie.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of each round, players place their bets on either the Player hand, the Banker hand, or the Tie. Once bets are placed, two cards are dealt to both the Player and Banker hands. Depending on the total value of the first two cards dealt, a third card may be drawn for either or both hands based on specific rules.</p>
            <p>The hand with a total closest to 9 wins the round. If the Player and Banker hands have the same total, the round results in a Tie. The rules governing whether a third card is drawn are automatic, so players do not need to make any decisions beyond placing their initial bets.</p>
